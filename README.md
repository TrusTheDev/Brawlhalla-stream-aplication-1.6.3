## Description

This desktop application retrieves player data from the Brawlhalla API and stores it in text files dynamically for use in programs like OBS Studio. By referencing a player list in an Excel table with associated IDs, the app automatically fetches relevant information when a player's name is entered, updating the text files for seamless integration with OBS.
